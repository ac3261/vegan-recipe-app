# Welcome to Vegan Pantry Chef

Vegan Pantry Chef turns the ingredients already in your kitchen into balanced, plant-based meals. This short guide shows exactly what you can do on the page where you build recipes.

## At a glance

- Add ingredients from the built-in pantry search or create your own entries.
- Choose the meal type, nutrition goal, servings, and optional chef notes.
- Generate a full recipe with timing, instructions, nutrition, and tips.
- Reset the form or regenerate to explore more variations.

Use **Using the App** for a step-by-step walkthrough and **FAQ** for fast answers to common questions. If you are looking for developer setup details, head back to the main project README.
