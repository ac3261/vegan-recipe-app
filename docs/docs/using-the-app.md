# Using the App

This guide walks through the core actions your see inside Vegan Pantry Chef.

## 1. Add what you have

- Start typing in the **Search ingredients** field to pick from common vegan staples.
- Click a suggestion to add it to your list. You can keep adding as many as you like.
- Need something that is not listed? Type the name in **Add custom** and press **Add**.
- Use the small note field under each item to add context such as “frozen” or “ripe today.”

## 2. Tell the chef your goals

- Choose a **Meal focus** like Breakfast or Dinner so the assistant matches the time of day.
- Pick a **Dietary focus** (Balanced, High Protein, Low Carb, High Fiber, Gluten Free) to guide nutrition.
- Adjust **Servings** between one and six depending on how many people you are feeding.
- Share optional **Notes for the chef** to include preferences, appliances, or anything to avoid.

## 3. Generate and refine

- Click **Generate recipe**. A spinner lets you know the AI is working.
- Review the returned card, which includes recipe name, description, timing, ingredients, step-by-step instructions, nutrition, and optional tips.
- Want another idea with the same inputs? Use **Regenerate**.
- Ready for a fresh start? Hit **Reset** to clear everything and begin again.

## Helpful reminders

- You need at least one ingredient before you can generate.
- All model responses stay in your browser session; refresh the page to clear history.
- Copy the parts you love directly from the recipe card to save them elsewhere.
