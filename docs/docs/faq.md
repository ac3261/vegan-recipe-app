# FAQ

## Do I need to sign in?

No account is required. Open the Vegan Pantry Chef app link provided to you and start adding ingredients right away.

## Can I save or export recipes?

Saving and exporting are not available yet. Copy the parts you like from the recipe card and paste them into your notes or meal planner.

## Why are servings limited to six?

This range keeps ingredient amounts realistic. If you want to cook for more people, generate the recipe and then scale the ingredient quantities manually.

## How do I flag allergies or preferences?

Add a quick note to the ingredient (for example, “prefer gluten-free pasta”) or include details in the **Notes for the chef** box. The assistant uses those hints when creating the recipe.

## Something looks off—what should I do?

Tap **Regenerate** to request a new version, or use **Reset** to start fresh with different ingredients. If the issue keeps happening, share feedback with the team that gave you access to the app.
