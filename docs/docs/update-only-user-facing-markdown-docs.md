## Update Only User-Facing Markdown Docs

When a pull request targets the Vegan Pantry Chef project, update only the user-facing Markdown documentation under `docs/docs` to reflect end-user changes.

### Style Expectations

* Focus strictly on end-user behavior in the Vegan Pantry Chef app.
* Keep language friendly, concise, and geared toward home cooks using an AI helper.
* Prefer short paragraphs, bullet lists, and clear headings when describing flows.
* Avoid engineering terms, implementation details, or speculation.
* Use only ASCII characters in the final output.
